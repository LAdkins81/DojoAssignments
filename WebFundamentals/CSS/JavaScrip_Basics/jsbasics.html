      <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagin a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span>var x;</span></li>
        <li>Variable Assignment: Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns values to a variable. <span>var x=10;</span></li>
        <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to poerate on variable you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>4.14159</span>; String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span></li>
        <li><a href="#">Conditionals:</a> When you write code, you wat to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the folllowing conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we exectue this block of code;</li>
        <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programing language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat any action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
        <li><a href="#">Functions</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea. We open up the instruction manual and get started. First, we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly, there are a ton more tables, so let's call our function over and over and over again.</li>
